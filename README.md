# DCBstyle_portraits_unofficial

INCLUDES GENDER SWAP

Install Portraiture (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/999), then extract this mod into the mods folder, replace any.

Stardew Valley\Mods\Portraiture\Portraits\[HD] DCBurger+OrangePie+lunaktt(genderswap)
(you can rename the last folder to whatever you want)
Follow portraiture instructions to make sure the correct sprites are displayed:
  >Press P to change Portrait-Set when the DialogBox is open.
  >Press I to toggle between the larger portrait above the dialogue and the normal ones when the DialogBox is open.
  >Press O to fix or unfix a portrait-set selection of a specific NPC when their DialogBox is open, when fixed they will ignore further set changes and stay as they are.
I'm not sure it works with seasonal outfits or festivals. If I manage to make it work, I'll update the files with the fixed configs.

For dialogue changes (gender swap), I used this mod:

When you replace with the files of this repo, it will also replace the config files, since I've already gone through the trouble of adjusting it to be compatible.
If you don't want the gender swap, just don't include the mod and the contents of the "Gender Swap" folder.

To make sure sprites work, I used this mod:

Config file included
