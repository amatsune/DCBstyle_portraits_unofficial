# DCBstyle_portraits_unofficial

INCLUDES GENDER SWAP

Install Portraiture (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/999), then extract this mod into the mods folder, replace any.

Stardew Valley\Mods\Portraiture\Portraits\[HD] DCBurger+OrangePie+lunaktt(genderswap)
(you can rename the last folder to whatever you want)

For dialogue changes (gender swap), I used this mod:

When you replace with the files of this repo, it will also replace the config files, since I've already gone through the trouble of adjusting it to be compatible.
If you don't want the gender swap, just don't include the mod and the contents of the "Gender Swap" folder.

To make sure sprites work, I used this mod:

Config file included
